1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/vpaniza/KletaStarWars.git
2. Get into the root folder
3. Run: 

`npm run devStart` -> if you want to run locally. The website will be hosted port 5000

4. On the browser go into: http://localhost:5000/
5. A form for sign in should appear. Use the following credentials:
